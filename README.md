Open Weather Map API

### Open Weather Map API Project

This small project is a single page application that was created to test the Open Weather Map API using Vanilla Javascript.  
Once the app is loaded, it will prompt the user to share their location. Alternatively, users can set their own location and fetch the api to get the current weather data.  


## Technologies Used:
* Fetch API
* Javascript
* CSS including animations

### V0: 
- Get user location (latitude, longitude)

  - Loading css animation: css loading animation is shown before the user shares location.
- User entered location: Users can enter their own location.
- Error handling: Error message shown when city cannot be found. Error message will be displayed if the entered city cannot be found. Users can the, re-try with a different city name.
